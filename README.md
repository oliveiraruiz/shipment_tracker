# shipment_tracker
Personal project to learn Data Science

The idea started when I found how tedious it was to track a shipment using the the brazilian Correios interface. Alerts were not always workings, and the companies which uses their service have a poor link with their tracker, so I decided to create a bot to monitor the shipments for me. I am a Mechatronics Engineer starting to study data science and artificial inteligence this year, and this project suits perfectly as a starter.

With this base idea and the success in achieving Rev0, I am thinking about going a step further and apply data science to this projet. How? Transforming the webcrawler data into a dataset, and using this dataset to understand shipment timing, noticing if a shipment is taking longer than the average to reach the destination.
